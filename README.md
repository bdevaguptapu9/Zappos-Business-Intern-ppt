# Zappos-Business-Intern-ppt
Zappos Business Intern challange
Zappos is interested in attracting new customers to its website. The
 purpose of this assignment is twofold. First, we need your help in
 identifying a missing demographic that will add the highest dollar value to
 the company. Second, we need to make sure we have the appropriate value
 props in place to attract and maintain these customers.

 The objective of this assignment is to present a deep understanding of a
 particular demographic and provide ways to attract this demographic to
 Zappos. You should make sure you understand the lifestyle (work, family,
 and leisure), attitude toward brands and media, as well as purchase and
 spending behaviors.

 Include the answers to these questions in your presentation:
 • What does this demographic look like?
 • How does their lifestyle affect their spending behaviors?
 • How does this group differ from others, and what can be done to best
 serve this customer group?
 • Are any competitors attracting this demographic?

 In addition, it will be important to identify Zappos’ value props.
 • Are these the right value props for this demographic?
 • How do these value props, or ones you suggest, compare to competitors?
